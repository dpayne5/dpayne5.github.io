This is my personal page built from Jami Gibb's wonderful [phantom template](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/phantom).


To run this locally do:

  ```bash
  gem install bundler
  bundle install
  bundle exec jekyll serve
  ```
  
  You may need to append your commands with `sudo` if you're getting a permissions error.
